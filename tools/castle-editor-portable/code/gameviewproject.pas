    a key, a mouse button, or touches a touch-screen.

    Note that each UI control has also events like OnPress and OnClick.
    These events can be used to handle the "press", if it should do something
    specific when used in that UI control.
    The TViewProject.Press method should be used to handle keys
    not handled in children controls.

  {
  if Event.IsKey(keyXxx) then
