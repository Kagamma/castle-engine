  Window.ParseParameters; // allows to control window size / fullscreen on the command-line
  Application.MainWindow := Window;

  { Adjust window fullscreen state and size.
    Note that some platforms (like mobile) may ignore it.
    Examples how to set window fullscreen state and size:

      Window.FullScreen := true;

    or

      Window.FullScreen := false; // default
      Window.Width := 600;
      Window.Height := 400;

    or

      Window.FullScreen := false; // default
      Window.Width := Application.ScreenWidth * 2 div 3;
      Window.Height := Application.ScreenHeight * 2 div 3;
  }

  { You should not need to do *anything* more in the unit "initialization" section.
    Most of your game initialization should happen inside ApplicationInitialize.
    In particular, it is not allowed to read files before ApplicationInitialize
    (because in case of non-desktop platforms,
    some necessary resources may not be prepared yet). }
