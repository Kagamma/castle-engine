      There's usually no need to call this, as the destructor or opening
      a new ZIP archive using @link(Open) will first close the existing archive.

      The caller is responsible for freeing the returned stream.

      The stream is positioned at the beginning,
      so you can read from it immediately.

      to access the ZIP contents by just reading from a given URL protocol
      using @link(Download) routine (or any routine on top of it).

      For example, you can register a URL handler for 'my-textures' prefix:

      @longCode(
        var
          Zip: TCastleZip;
        begin
          Zip := TCastleZip.Create;

          finally FreeAndNil(Zip) end;
        end;

      Full example usage in the @url(https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/network/custom_url_handler
      examples/network/custom_url_handler).

      ZIP doesn't have to be @link(IsOpen) when calling this.
      In fact, you can close and reopen the ZIP file while the URL handler
      continues to be registered.
      But it has to be open when you actually read using the indicated URL
      protocol. }
    procedure RegisterUrlProtocol(const Protocol: String);

    { Unregister the URL protocol handler registered by @link(RegisterUrlProtocol).
      This is automatically done when destroying
      the @link(TCastleZip) instance. }
    procedure UnregisterUrlProtocol;

    { Create a new file entry inside the ZIP.
      If the given path already existed in the ZIP, it is overwritten.

      There are 2 overloads, one taking a TStream and one taking a URL of the
      file to be added.

      @unorderedList(
        @item(For overload with URL:

          We will read the URL contents and add them to the ZIP.

          We will also use some of the "metadata" of the URL,
          which in practice now means: if the URL indicates a local file,
          we will look at the file modification time and Unix permissions
          and store them alongside the ZIP entry.)

        @item(For overload with TStream:

          We expect the provided stream to be positioned at the beginning,
          and we will read from it until the end. We assume nothing
          about the given TStream, in particular we don't assume that it is seekable,
          we don't assume it has useful TStream.Size. We will process it using
          @link(ReadGrowingStream).

          Note that there's no way to provide the "metadata" of the file
          (like file modification, Unix permissions)
          when you provide a stream. For this reason we advise to use the
          overload with URL whenever possible.

          When OwnsStream, we will take care of freeing the Stream.
          The work may be more efficient then (because when OwnsStream=false
          we may have to do a copy of stream, to have it available for later),
          so use OwnsStream = @true when possible.
        )
      )

      After this is called, the new file entry appears in the @link(FileList).

      The ZIP archive is not saved to disk until you call @link(Save).
      If you call @link(Close) without calling @link(Save), the changes
      are lost. @link(Save) is never called automatically. }

    procedure Write(const PathInZip: String; const Url: String); overload;

      done by @link(Write)) to the given URL. }
    procedure Save(const Url: String);

    { Read-only list of all files within the ZIP archive.
      All entries are valid as arguments for @link(Read),
      so they are relative paths within the zip archive,
      with parts separated by slashes.

      No order of the contents is guaranteed.

      @raises EZipNotOpen If the ZIP archive is not open. }
    property FileList: TStrings read GetFileList;

    (* TODO: maybe, if needed:

    { Extract all files from the ZIP archive into the given path,
      recreating the subdirectory structure of the ZIP inside TargetPath.

      The TargetPathUrl should be an URL of an existing directory.
      It may but doesn't have to end with slash.
      It will be combined with the relative URLs of the files
      inside ZIP using @link(CombineUri).

      TODO: remember to convert relative paths -> URL.
      Do we need to percent-encode?
      How do we handle spaces in paths in ZIP?
      How do we handle %20 in paths in ZIP?

      at Read, FileList, and other routines that take/return PathInZip.
